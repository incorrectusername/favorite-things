### 2. How long did you spend on the coding test below? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.
- I spend overall 2 weeks working on it, 1¹⁄₂-2¹⁄₂ hours everyday.
- Improvements: I would have wrote tests on frontend, better error handling and more better code quality on frontend.

### 3. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.
- f strings.
	> \>>> user_id = "user_id" <br/>
	>  \>>> f"user with id:{user_id} is selected"<br/>
	'user with id:123 is selected'
	> \>>> 
- typing module
	> \>>>def save_new_user(email: str, password: str):<br/>
	>	...	
- dictionaries retain order.
  
### 4. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
   Logging is the key.
   Logging execution time and/or memory took by the complex function to completely run.
   Monitoring CPU usage via `htop/top`. 
    
   I have done it few time at my current job.
